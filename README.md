# Jupiter Metis  

We’re all familiar with using our favorite chat apps and we often just assume we can trust them with our personal information. It’s not until our private life is compromised do we suddenly reconsider how we’re doing things. 

Next generation chat application Metis improves your privacy by defaulting to locally encrypt all communications before sending any message.

With Jupiter Metis, you always have the power over your privacy and what, if anything, is shared. No central servers store any information about you, your account, or conversations. There’s no signup required and participating in group chats is as simple and secure as it gets.

Metis runs on the blockchain and is 100% encrypted with AES encryption. By using blockchain to talk, you’re protecting your communications and keeping your chats private!

Try it out at https://metis.gojupiter.tech, then build your own instance!

This is a 100% local instance of Metis that talks to Jupiter's blockchain. Anyone can complete these steps and create their own private, encrypted, and shielded communications. Even though this is a local only instance, you can log into ANY Metis instance with your credentials and it will still work and have all your past conversations waiting for you! This is due to all your conversations being encrypted and stored on Jupiter's decentralized blockchain.

If you want to start the system using docker, it is necessary to execute the following steps.

1. Install **docker**
2. Install **docker-compose**
3. Clone the repository code https://github.com/jupiter-project/metis.git
	`git clone https://github.com/jupiter-project/metis.git`
4. It is necessary to switch to the dev branch
	`cd metis`
	`git checkout dev`
	`git pull`
5. Inside the code folder execute the commands
   `docker-compose build --force-rm`
   `docker-compose up`
   
6. This command will start a mongodb container, a redis container and a metis container.
7. Open your browser and type in 127.0.0.1:4000
